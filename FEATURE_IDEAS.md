# Feature Ideas for ppokemon

This document outlines potential new features to enhance the ppokemon project.

## 1. Hyperparameter Tuning and Experiment Tracking

*   **Description:** The current `main.py` uses fixed hyperparameters for PPO training (e.g., `learning_rate`, `n_steps`, `batch_size` are commented out, implying defaults are used). Training RL agents is very sensitive to these. Implementing a system for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using Optuna or Ray Tune) and integrating an experiment tracking tool (e.g., Weights & Biases, MLflow) would allow for more systematic improvement of the agent's performance.
*   **Value:** Significantly improve the agent's learning efficiency and final performance by finding optimal hyperparameters. It would also make the development process more organized and reproducible.

## 2. Expanded Feature Engineering in `embed_battle()`

*   **Description:** The `embed_battle` function currently has a placeholder comment: `# ----- YOUR FEATURE ENGINEERING GOES HERE -----` and only extracts very basic features (HP fraction, status of active Pokemon). A crucial aspect of RL is the quality of the state representation. This feature would involve adding many more detailed features, such as:
    *   All stats (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) of active and opponent Pokemon.
    *   Type information for Pokemon and their moves (using one-hot encoding).
    *   Information about each move for the active Pokemon (PP, power, type, accuracy, status effects).
    *   Boosts and debuffs currently active.
    *   Team composition details (e.g., types of Pokemon in the team, status of benched Pokemon).
    *   Field conditions (weather, hazards like Stealth Rock, Spikes, etc.).
*   **Value:** A richer feature set will provide the agent with more information to make better decisions, potentially leading to a much stronger AI. The current 70-feature placeholder is unlikely to capture the complexity of a Pokemon battle.

## 3. Agent Evaluation Against Different Opponents

*   **Description:** Currently, the agent is trained against a `RandomPlayer`. To better assess its capabilities and identify weaknesses, an evaluation framework could be added. This would involve:
    *   Creating a pool of different opponent types (e.g., `SimpleHeuristicsPlayer` which is already imported, a previously saved version of the PPO agent, or even loading models from a model zoo if available).
    *   After training, or periodically during training, run a set number of evaluation battles against each opponent type in this pool.
    *   Track win rates and other relevant metrics (e.g., average battle duration, damage dealt) against each opponent.
*   **Value:** This provides a much more robust way to measure the agent's true skill and generalization capabilities beyond just playing against random moves. It can help identify areas where the agent struggles and guide further improvements.
